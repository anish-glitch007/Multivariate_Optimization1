(1) Using line (unidirectional) search, for the function (w1 - 10 )^2 + (w2 - 10)^2, find the minimum value along the direction (3, 7). You can assume the start point to be (2, 5). Plot the function and its contours along with the minimum value in that direction. Is the search direction a gradient descent one? Comment on that as well.

(2) Using steepest gradient descent, find the local minimum for the function in the problem 1 (i.e. J(w1, w2) = (w1 - 10 )^2 + (w2 - 10)^2). While applying gradient descent, do the following (a) Fixing the value for alpha (b) use line search to determine the value for alpha. Plot the intermediate steps in the iteration to show the minimal point in that direction.
